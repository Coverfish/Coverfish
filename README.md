### Hi, I'm Coverfish 👋

I have absolutely no idea what I’m doing, but I’m having a ridiculous amount of fun doing it.

I kind of stumbled into AI-assisted programming and it instantly became the thing my brain won’t shut up about. I think in “this is annoying, how can I automate it?” and then throw Python/C/C++ + AI at the problem until something useful falls out.

Most of what I build sits somewhere between:

- 🐍 **Python tools & desktop apps**  
  Tkinter UIs, scanners & QR workflows, search/filter logic, file import/export, small utilities to measure and visualize things, stats and graphs with Matplotlib, etc.

- ⚙️ **Automation & glue code**  
  Scripts that talk to legacy web apps, small RPA-style helpers, tools that connect phones, scanners, QR codes, Excel/CSV and local desktop apps into one workflow.

- 📊 **Data & visual feedback**  
  Custom spaced repetition logic, review forecasts, heatmaps, accuracy tracking, code snapshot/line counters – anything that lets me “see” what’s going on over time.

- 💡 **Low-level / embedded tinkering**  
  C/C++ experiments, simple world/terrain generation, microcontroller projects (PIC, 7-seg displays, multiplexing, rectifiers, triggers), and the firmware to drive them.

The way I work:

- describe what I want in way too much detail  
- let AI help draft the code  
- wire it to real hardware or real data  
- debug obsessively until it behaves how I imagined  

My brain currently won’t let me sleep without thinking about new features, weird edge cases, or imaginary bugs that don’t even exist yet. I’m still learning the “proper” theory behind a lot of what I use – but making useful things and automating boring work has me completely hooked.

If it removes repetitive tasks from real-world environments (workshops, warehouses, factories) by gluing together electronics + software + AI, I’m probably interested.
